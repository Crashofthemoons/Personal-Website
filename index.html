        <p>I am currently attending Nashville Software School to become a Full Stack Software Developer. My background experience of six years using medical software in optometry and dental form manufacturing has given me a unique perspective on software development and product design. It is my goal to develop solutions for tech industry projects from web to application development.</p>

        <h3 class='about'>Spec Trek is an application I created for Opticians who place orders with their Optical Lab. This app will track the status of each order, eliminating the need for Opticians to call the Lab each time they need information about an order. There are two credentials for this app, Optician and Technician. Each have different purposes and functionalities. Opticians are able to order, edit, delete and receive orders, while Technicians are able to change the order status of each order, or restart orders as needed.
